This is my own excel project on analyzing workflow for a compounding pharmacy

I used Pivot Tables, slicers and made a dynamic dashboard visualization using only excel

As part of my compounding pharmacy workflow project, I extracted data from compound scheduling and input it into Excel for trend analysis, 
aligning it with the calendar and incoming workflow queue. I then collaborated with compounders and pharmacists to adjust scheduling based 
on business needs, ensuring an optimized and efficient workflow. Additionally, I utilized Power BI to enhance data visualization, providing 
clearer insights for decision-making
